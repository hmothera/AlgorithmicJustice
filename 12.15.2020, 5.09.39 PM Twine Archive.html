You&#39;ve been instructed to create an algorithm so flawless that it will display none of the biases that humans so often succumb to when handing out justice.

However, to minimize computational complexity, the AI can prioritize only one key variable about the defendant when making its decision.

</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="10" name="Joanna" tags="" position="575,1625" size="200,100">You knock on the door, and a voice rings out: &quot;Come in!&quot;
A woman is sitting at a giant desk with 5 monitors floating around it. She’s somehow eating a burger without the use of either of her hands as she furiously types away at her glowing keyboard. 

&quot;Office hours don&#39;t start for another 30 minutes, but if it&#39;s an urgent question —&quot;

She turns in her swivel chair to face you and the sandwich falls to the floor. Her stunned face makes you smile.

&quot;Hello Professor,&quot; you joke, but it&#39;s halfhearted. &quot;Any major bugs in the program recently?&quot;

&quot;The Algorithm doesn&#39;t make mistakes, Ava,&quot; She responds immediately, in a mechanical tone. You nod. After doing a quick sweep to make sure the corridor outside is empty, you lock the office door and activate the radio frequency jammer in your pocket.

&quot;I&#39;m of the same opinion,&quot; she says in the same monotone. She surreptitiously jerks her thumb toward the underside of the whiteboard. 

[[Deactivate the bug]]

&quot;That&#39;s not what I want,&quot; you say. &quot;I don&#39;t want your shady government backdoors. I&#39;m not switching places with him, but I&#39;m not leaving him to rot in jail. There&#39;s got to be another way&quot;

Marcus looks exasperated. &quot;If there is, you won&#39;t find it through me. How do you still have an ounce of idealism in you? The execution is in 3 days. Some situations are too desperate to wait for a better answer.&quot;

&lt;&lt;elseif $songuilt is 1&gt;&gt;

&lt;&lt;/if&gt;&gt;

You almost dial Jeremy&#39;s number before remembering that all his possessions were confiscated after the trial.

Guess you&#39;ll have to wait until there&#39;s another way to contact him.

[[Back-&gt;Phone List]] </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="14" name="Leave the Visitor&#39;s Center" tags="" position="446,881" size="100,100">
You stand on the busy streets of the city, looking off toward the Capital. The tick of every second brings you closer to the decisions you know might destroy you.

It&#39;s time for you to choose. 

How will you save your son with odds like these? You can&#39;t do it alone.

It&#39;s time to call someone for help.

You&#39;re sitting at a cafe watching the pigeons peck at crumbs on the sidewalk when someone drops their napkin straight into your cup of coffee.

&quot;Oops,&quot; a voice chuckles in your ear.

Marcus gracefully slides into the seat across from you. His gray suit and tie are immaculate. 

You resist the urge to grimace, trying to figure out his game. It was always a risk asking for favors from people who knew his true involvement with $algoname. You needed to stay on his good side.

[ @TODO: Add more dialogue here ]

Your conversation is safely folded into the hubbub from pedestrians and streetgoers nearby.

Marcus pulls an innocuous-looking manila-colored file out of his briefcase. He hesitates almost imperceptibly before sliding it across the wire-wrought table toward you.

You glance at him quizzically, then open it. There&#39;s a stack of forms inside, labeled &quot;EXCEPTION REPORT&quot;.

&quot;You could switch places with him.&quot;

You look up in shock. 

&quot;Are you serious? The system allows for that?&quot; you ask, incredulous. You had never known the government to show such leniency with its criminal system.

&quot;Well...no. But...that paperwork could make it happen. If that&#39;s what you wanted.&quot; He doesn&#39;t meet your eyes.

&quot;What about the charges?&quot; you press. &quot;Will the execution still proceed?&quot; Doubt brews in your gut, but desperation is speaking louder than anything.

He looks genuinely nervous for once. &quot;I don&#39;t know. There are ways...I don&#39;t know. But I do know how much you care about your son. I get it.&quot;

You rifle through the forms. Sixty jargon-filled pages of paper could set your boy free. But even if this works, what are the chances you&#39;ll actually be able to make it out of prison in time?

You wake up and your nose immediately fills with the stench of sweat, urine, and fear. It&#39;s so stifling that you almost wish you were unconscious again.

It had been easier than you&#39;d expected to switch places with him. With the help of Marcus, Jeremy had been escorted out last night. Hours later, you were thrown in unceremoniously on some trumped-up charges that you fabricated. 

It didn&#39;t make up for anything, but at least he was safe.

Now this was your problem alone.

You look around the dank cell. It&#39;s barren save for a lanky teenager seated in the corner opposite from you. He looks relaxed, casually lobbing a ball repeatedly against the concrete cell wall with a soft //thunk//. He doesn&#39;t give any sign of noticing that you&#39;re conscious.

“Welp,” you say, looking down at your cup, “That grumpy barista gave me a Cruella de Vil this time. Was I too loud in there?”

The black-haired boy beside you grins as you both leave the tiny coffee shop. The foamy white face of Scar from The Lion King floats on top of his latte. “You practically screamed. Everyone in there thought you were being murdered by me or something. Was my grade in math really that shocking?”

You sigh melodramatically, the breath coming out in a billowy cloud in the wintry air. “I just can’t believe that a human being with my DNA hates math. Truly a tragedy. We better behave ourselves or we’ll only get villains in our coffee for the rest of the year.&quot;

“The villains are the more interesting characters anyway,” your son quips, wrapping his scarf tighter around his neck.

You know that in the wrong room, near the wrong cameras, a statement like that could get him in trouble. Or more accurately, in trouble for having the potential to be in trouble. Your stomach tightens involuntary with fear.

It&#39;s a quiet, snowy morning in Washington, D.C. Despite the cold, the sidewalks are packed with city goers trying to get to work. The sun is nowhere in sight, but the warm glow of street lamps overhead is enough to light the way to the bus station. 

You plop down onto an open bench underneath the hood of the station and doublecheck the transportation schedule on your tiny Comms Screen. A little notification pops up for an incoming message. It’s encrypted.

&lt;&lt;/linkappend&gt;&gt;

Jeremy’s eyes are unfocused as he stares at the bustling crowds. His glasses are fogged up with steam.

&quot;Hey,&quot; you nudge his elbow with yours. 

[[&quot;What&#39;s on your mind?&quot;]]
[[&quot;How&#39;s the coffee?&quot;]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="44" name="&quot;What&#39;s on your mind?&quot;" tags="" position="525,550" size="100,100">“What’s on your mind?”
He shrugs. “Another one of my classmates got arrested yesterday.”
You tense.
“I know the pre-crime tests are to make the city safer, but...I know some of these guys. A lot of them would never hurt a flea.”
“It’s like they’re being picked off, one by one...and they all look the same. Maybe the tests aren&#39;t-” 
Before he can say anything else you clap a hand over his mouth instinctively. 
“Not here.” 
He shoves your hand away with a grimace. “I don’t get why I have to be so hush-hush about it. What’s the worst they can do? And who is they anyway?”
You know the answers. And you also know that they would give him nightmares. There’s that familiar twinge of guilt, the same twinge you feel almost every day that you lie to your son about what you do for a living. 
But at least he was safe, safer than you were growing up. In just 10 years since Project ${algoname} had been implemented, crime in the most dangerous parts of the city had gone down astronomically. What could be more effective than detecting crime before it even happened? 

[[&quot;...&quot;]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="45" name="&quot;How&#39;s the coffee?&quot;" tags="" position="388,551" size="100,100">//“How’s the coffee?”// 

He takes a sip of his overpriced brew and makes a sound of delight. “The milk ratio is just right.” 

In that moment, there are a few things you know that he doesn’t.

You know that 4 tiny input feeds hidden in the screen next to you have just picked up everything he said and did, down to the scrunched-up expression on his face. You know that these feeds operate on a 24/7 basis in every public transportation vehicle and public space in the city. You know that on a remote server in a data center lying at the bottom of the ocean, a computer program just &lt;&lt;linkappend &quot;thought:&quot; t8n&gt;&gt;

&lt;&lt;/linkappend&gt;&gt; 

And you know exactly how this program thinks, because you helped write it.

“Hang on, did we even order? I didn’t notice until now, but for some reason they always give me this exact drink even when you don’t say anything to them. And we’ve never been to that cafe before.”

Now it was your turn to shrug in a hopefully convincing “don’t ask me” gesture.

“I don’t know, maybe you look like a milk-coffee dude. ” 

He gives you a sharp glance. “You think they analyze that stuff?” 

You swear under your breath and don’t say anything more in the hopes that he drops it. There’s that familiar twinge of guilt, the same twinge you feel almost every day that you lie to your son about what you do for a living. 

The price of safety is privacy, or so your boss has told you countless times. 9 days out of 10, you’ll take that trade-off. 

[[&quot;...&quot;]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="46" name="&quot;...&quot;" tags="" position="417,692" size="100,100">At your silence he just shakes his head and digs his hands into his pockets.

Your bus pulls up first, on schedule. You turn to give Jeremy your obligatory mom fist-bump, but he won&#39;t look at you.

The bus is more crowded than usual as you make your way to a seat. Sitting alone with his hood up and his long black coat, your kid looks like a tiny grim reaper. You hope his bus comes soon.

And then: through the dusty window, you see a dull gray metallic arm clamp onto his left shoulder from behind. Alarm bells ring in your head. There are startled shouts from the crowd.

Jeremy turns and screams. Handcuffs appear on his wrists.

You try to stand, jostling the passengers around you to try and make it to the exit. It’s like wading through a brick wall. 

He slumps over and more robots surround him. 

The doors of the bus begin to close.

You scream his name and almost claw the driver’s eyes out with panic, but arms hold you back.  

Your Comms unit buzzes with a notification. It’s another email, but you barely register it.

When you catch another glimpse of the station through the window, the crowd has evaporated. An empty coffee cup lays overturned on the spot where your kid stood minutes earlier, the liquid slowly staining the snow black.

You don&#39;t have the kind of job that affords days off.

&quot;Ava? Did you hear me?&quot;

You blink. Your colleagues are all staring at you with expectant expressions.

&quot;I was asking for your recap on the impact of Embedded Surveillance phase 2?&quot; your boss taps his pencil against his laptop. To anyone peering in he would look like a middle school computer science teacher, with his long white lab coat and shirt that reads //&quot;I&#39;m code-blooded!&quot;// Not a person here in the $algoname Artificial Intelligence Lab could even tell the difference from a pipette and a syringe, but they really took the &quot;Lab&quot; part to heart. 

&quot;Oh right, sorry,&quot; you begin. Your tongue is dry as sandpaper. &quot;To refresh everyone&#39;s memory, ES Phase 2 was the rollout of data gathering networks in public transportation stations. It has been...remarkably impactful in expanding the size of $algoname &#39;s training datasets. Detailed accuracy metrics are not available yet, but we expect to hear back from the Ethics committee in a week.&quot;

At the mention of the committee, faces around the room go sour with distaste. Murmurs start. 

//Not much of a committee, is it...//
//...Her only real contribution...//
//Can&#39;t believe she left...this is a joke//

Your boss smiles and claps his hands to quiet the room. He stands for dramatic effect.

&quot;Prognostic criminal detection was controversial for many years worldwide, but since its implementation it has met all our milestones for crime reduction in urban areas. The Administration has commended our team specifically for our research and contributions to $algoname. Great work, everyone!&quot;

You stand up shakily to head back to your desk.

&quot;Ava!&quot; your boss motions you over. &quot;There&#39;s something I&#39;d like to discuss with you.&quot; 

At that exact moment, your Comms unit starts buzzing insistently. It&#39;s an &lt;&lt;linkappend &quot;incoming call from...&quot; t8n&gt;&gt;a number that you don&#39;t recognize.&lt;&lt;/linkappend&gt;&gt;

You shake your head. &quot;We&#39;ve had some promising candidates but they usually get scared away at the third interview. Not many are willing to sign the contract once they see the NDA.&quot;

He makes a sound of frustration. &quot;We need her back. She made a lot of noise about morals but she was one of the best. We don&#39;t have time to train someone new.&quot;

&quot;I learned a lot from her,&quot; you agree. 

&quot;Say, didn&#39;t you mention that you two used to go to college together?&quot;

You nod, apprehensive. He hands you a small black device. It has a tiny red button on the side.

“Don’t you see? The problem isn’t whether $algoname is ‘wrong’ or ‘right’. The problem is that we are taking its decisions as the wrong or the right. We have designated it as our one pure moral voice, separate from our human biases... when really it just has the prejudice of 100 years of humans combined in one brain.”

[[Look at your desk]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="11" name="uh...surprise?" tags="" position="277,541" size="100,100">You left out a half-hearted boo and she doesn’t laugh, but her eyes crinkle a bit at the corners. She’s letting you off easy.

NA’KIA: Uh huh. I know the party last night was something else, but I still wanted to give you the chance to join me on my usual morning, now early afternoon hike today. Feel like joining the land of the living?

[[sure]]
[[I&#39;ll pass]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="12" name="sure" tags="" position="202,691" size="100,100">NA’KIA: Really?? I mean, uh, yes, great! I already made some breakfast in the kitchen that I was gonna leave for ya, but it’s calling your name now I guess!

I’ll go grab my phone and refill my water bottle. See ya in a bit.

*NA’KIA leaves the room*

[[get out of bed]] </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="13" name="I&#39;ll pass" tags="" position="352,691" size="100,100">NA’KIA looks disappointed, but doesn’t press the matter. 

NA’KIA: Oh, okay man. Well, rest up then. 

She pats your hand as she stands up to leave.

NA’KIA: Woah dude, you’re pretty cold. Might wanna pull those blankets a bit tighter!

*NA’KIA leaves the room*

</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="14" name="Make your bed" tags="" position="643,14" size="100,100">I bet your mom would be proud--good kid. 

[[Get dressed]] 
[[Look at your desk]] </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="15" name="Get dressed" tags="" position="645,267" size="100,100">Thinking about typical fall weather, you go to put on a hoodie, some thicker socks maybe, but when you step in front of your dresser, that sunlight peeking through feels warm. Really warm. 

You think about how climate change is a thing and elect instead for a light, short-sleeved t-shirt, but decide to keep the long pants and thick socks. 

[[Breakfast time!]]
[[Look at your desk]] </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="16" name="Look at your desk" tags="" position="645,138" size="100,100">There’s your journal, your laptop, and some miscellaneous school-work. Behind everything is a mini cork-board where you see the flyer for that party you and Na’kia went to last night.

Why is that kind of fuzzy? You don’t drink much and certainly have never drank enough to black-out (you feel relatively fine right now too). What happened last night?

[[Breakfast time!]] </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="17" name="Breakfast time!" tags="" position="794,258" size="100,100">You exit the room and scarf down some food. It’s tasty as always--Na’kia is a great cook--but...you still feel hungry afterward as if you didn’t eat at all. 

[[Time to hike!]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="18" name="Time to hike!" tags="" position="924,263" size="100,100">You see Na’kia waving you down from the end of the driveway.

NA’KIA: C’mon! I was checking to see if that one package came in, but nothing yet so I’m ready to go.

It’s become a tad overcast now, but when you step outside, the clouds move and the sun shines bright. 

You take a step off the porch into the light and--

[[Oh no.]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="19" name="Oh no." tags="" position="1051,263" size="100,100">You’re unbearably warm. Uncomfortably hot. You..

You might be on fire. Is that the smell of smoke entering your nose? 

[[Faint]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="20" name="Faint" tags="" position="1182,264" size="100,100">You return to consciousness on the couch. There are welts on your arm, but as you look at them, they begin to fade away and your skin is clear and shines like enamel. 

You look up. Unsurprisingly, Na’Kia looks back, eyes on your arm too before rising to meet your gaze. 

NA’KIA: Well. Not to go all Twilight on ya, but I think I know what you are.

NA’KIA: Well…since you asked. I didn’t want to go mom-mode and lecture you right away (*I was planning on that during the hike*) but I couldn’t find you for half the night dude. Which uh, pretty not cool when we went together. 

She pauses.

[[And?]]
[[Wait silently.]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="23" name="And?" tags="" position="728,391" size="100,100">NA’KIA: And then when I did find you...you seemed on-edge and like maybe you were high on something? 

NA&#39;KIA: I-I&#39;d rather not talk about this right now actually. I&#39;m gonna head out for a hike, okay? There&#39;s some breakfast in the kitchen. 

*She stands to leave*

Right. You think he might’ve been a football player. He kept saying something about the new stadium, anyway. 

For some reason, the side of your neck throbs at the thought of him.
